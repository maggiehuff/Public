This repository will have projects with no sensitive data. This is a simplified version of the python code I use to calculate sound speed in shocked iron. It is worse in some aspects because I could not include the full equation of state tables to do impedance matching calculations. I used linear fits to the specified data instead; where in some cases the actual result deviated further from the linear fit than others. However, it is still useful for walking through the steps and checking the effects of different components of the measurement on the result.
